Significant Transgressive Communications were found attached to the final broadcast image to be transmitted, including the email address of an associate of the Traitor. We are attempting to isolate communications from said Transgressor, as they are said to be in possession of various Critical Documents that have been taken from Building 17. In particular, several pieces of ephemera used to access the upper floors.
Pager Message: On another matter, Staff investigating and attempting to extract data from corrupted or questionable ephemera are asked to keep a public list of all attempts made in conjunction with the use of classified software. We ask so that those working where others left off for the day have a list of what not to try as key-phrases, as well as, so that hypothetical technologies can ascertain if there is any error with the software or methods used.
deepdive — 08/16/2020

We can confirm that the list made by a Visitor contains a correct key for a Map from: The 'Hemming' Super-Synchronisation Research Database. For anyone doing another pass, do be sure to rename the filename on extraction and not use default file names. Also, be sure to note that files extracted from corrupted ephemera may appear corrupt themselves, but on most occasions are not. Hypothetical Technologies has also confirmed with Analysis that the map taken directly from The Topography Room Server does output, despite any form of compression that may occur in the uploading or downloading of copied material. We find the same results from the physical map as well as copies uploaded to the server. The transference of corrupt data from physical to digital has also been noted as 'extremely interesting' by those in Tectonics Convolution.

Pager Message: To The Visitor in The Atrium inquiring about Semantics, Semantics are usually topics, or words, that are related to a subject, peripherally relevant to the core subject or word in question. For example, Summer, Autumn, Spring and Winter are semantic aspects of Seasons. Semantics can also deal with metaphorical relations, similarities, in various concepts or ideas. Semantic Fields then can be a way of displaying semantics in a visual way. For example, Summer, Autumn, Spring and Winter are the semantic field in relation to Seasons.  As could also be, snowfall, heatwave, flowers blooming, leaves falling, would be a more abstract semantic field dealing with Seasons. Though, the Building 17 Pager System should not be a reliable resource for Scholarly Matters outside of Building 17.
deepdive — 08/24/2020
Pager Message: In relation to the previous Pager Message concerning Semantics, conversationally, Semantics can also be said to be highlighting of somethings relevance only by non-relevance. Something Semantic is something that is also related, but abstractly. In the case of Knight and Night, they would be Semantic in that they sound like the same word, but are not the same word. For example, Semantics in Spoken Language differs from Semantics in Written Language in that it involves Sensory Semantics. For example, the word "Where" - not pronouncing the H in Where might be considered Semantical, to the comprehension of the conversation. In spoken examples, the Spelling of a word may be Semantical to what is being said, if the meaning is conveyed appropriately. For example, for people with an accent, who say a word in a certain way, the phonetics of the word are Semantic to the Meaning, if the Meaning is conveyed.  In the example given, Night and Knight would only be part of a semantic field where, for example, Words That Sound The Same But Have Different Meanings is the relevant notion. Though, the Building 17 Pager System should not be a reliable resource for Scholarly Matters outside of Building 17.

Pager Message: To All Staff: Our Security Analysis Protocol that has been in-effect for a number or days has been completed. We can confirm that Transgressors have managed to exfiltrate Building 17 with at least one Device prototype from Hypothetical/Theoretical Technologies. The Device in question was incomplete, and had not yet been synched, or used, or activated, and was still in production. However, said Device already had confirmed Syphon Network Connectivity and several Core-Systems already in place. We assure all Staff that there is little to worry about, as, if a Device was to be activated outside of Building 17, we would surely pick up its signal during its initial power cycle and seek to retrieve it before any anomalous occurrences take place. Staff Pass Redemption, and any other systems or protocols that were previously unavailable have become available once more throught Building 17. All suspected Transgressor Staff Passes have been nullified of specific accesses in the database, except for Floor Access, which is a quirk of the erasure. We have never had to nullify a Staff Pass before, however, there should not be any Transgressor Staff Passes circulating, from what we can tell in Logistics.
Pager Message: If any staff have any information about the Transgressor Event that occurred mid-July local time, please come forward. The Director would also like to speak with Sumner when he is next available.
Pager Message: Also, as a means to heighten security, and as a general affordance, the VELK.AI protocol has been updated and upgraded by Theoretical Technologies.

Pager Message: To The Visitor in The Atrium consolidating about Errors, please note; Errors pertaining to Grammar or Spelling are not Errors in the tangible sense, and are an occupational and technologic hazard within Building 17. Logistics seem to award an Error, pertaining to Spelling and/or Grammar, to a Visitor or Staff who highlight Errors that are concerning misinformation or incorrect information when pertaining to spelling or written correspondences. Errors are awarded in the interest of correcting inconstancies with transmitted information, or temporal errors in Building 17, in addition to the more technical inconsistencies.
Pager Message: In reference to the last Pager Message: Visitors, please note, there is no observable benefit to receiving an Error other than an accolade that is attributed to a Visitor’s record. We have noticed that Errors Pending seem to circulate in and out of the database, with no award ever given. Someone in Hypothetical Technologies will have to corroborate with Logistics to look in to the reason. The Error system, after all, is supposedly reserved for the Technologies Departments and is purely attribution to reward technologists in their bug-fixing of Hypothetical and Theoretical Technologies.

Pager Message: The Director has been sampling the various gelatos being served in the building at the moment. He keeps singing "I'm the Gelato Man" over and over, kind of in the style of Tom Waits. We think he has had far too much gelato.

deepdive — 08/30/2020
Pager Message: The Director had no idea anyone was listening to The Intercom currently, and was alarmed  when a Visitor just mentioned the song that was playing in The Atrium Lounge. Luckily, there is no telepathy leak or temporal fluctuations.
deepdive — 08/31/2020
Pager Message: Visitors please note, only the intended Hallway may share the Intended Hallway's information to the  door. Also, please note; Logistic cannot hear what is being discussed over The Intercom, so be sure to not be accidentally broadcasting while discussing classified information.
deepdive — 08/31/2020
Pager Message: It has become clear that Visitors on The Second Floor have not been following protocol and  have been sharing classified information outside of their hallways. Logistics will soon arrive to make sure that all Classified Material is removed and replaced accordingly.
deepdive — 08/31/2020
Pager Message: Logistics has managed to contain the leak. Previous classified information has been destroyed and new materials have been delivered to The Kitchen and The Classroom for analysis. Hopefully Logistics didn't mix them up again.

Pager Message: Linguistics would like to inform Visitors in The Atrium that from what we can tell from Memory Resonance Records, Visitors may not be using the most comprehensive available alphabet reference for a certain language. However, it hasn't seemed to be a hindrance so far, so, take the notice as peripheral feedback from Linguistics.
deepdive — 09/01/2020
Pager Message: Linguistics would like to express the most comprehensive alphabet, that is also used by Linguistics, dealing with the  language in question, is not an alphabet sourced directly from the notes and field work of the diviner, but rather a comprehensive extrapolated alphabet from the works of the original diviner of the language, made by a third party.

Pager Message: Jimenez, you're needed in the server mainframe array. It seems the refreshments weren't delivered from the kitchen today. Please check the system logs for any anomalies in the automation directives.
Pager Message: The Director has said that Visitors, as well as staff can not go without refreshments, so, he's sending The Cleaners down with a temporary solution while we investigate the systems issue.
deepdive — 09/05/2020

Pager Message: As requested, The Puzzle Department has installed #the-puzzle-board in The Lobby to keep track of past puzzles from The Game Room. They don't seem to have a complete record of all the game room puzzles, they're actually pretty disorganised for puzzle makers. So, if anyone notices a puzzle missing from #the-puzzle-board, please contact maintenance privately.

deepdive — 09/08/2020
Pager Message: The Puzzle Department would like to express to The Visitor who designed the current puzzle in The Game Room that said puzzle is one of their favourites yet. Perhaps they are biassed, as it aligns with their personal interests and knowledge banks, particularly.

Pager Message: A Casual Broadcast will now play over The Intercom.

Pager Message: The Puzzle Department would like to extend the accolade of "Bamboozler" to the first Visitor at Lake Hemming to have a custom puzzle remain unsolved for more than 72 hours.
Pager Message: The Puzzle Department would also like to emphasise that the relevant answer given by Visitors in the past has absolutely nothing  to do with Battleship. They're not sure what gave you that idea.
Pager Message: We are performing a routine audio test over The Intercom.
deepdive — 09/09/2020

Pager Message: To Visitors in The Atrium; The Puzzle Department is currently preparing the next puzzle for The Game Room, however, we encourage any Associate Visitors who wish to submit a puzzle for The Game Room to do so if they so wish to be the author of the next puzzle in The Game Room.
deepdive — 09/09/2020
Pager Message: The Director just made himself laugh by sharing the following thought and general observation with his assistant; "You can acquire almost any object or item from a child for no more than five-thousand dollar or less. That amount of money is equivalent to a million dollars to an adult. However, children do not have anything good, nor any object that an adult could not acquire by other means for much less money." When asked why he was laughing, The Director just said the distribution of thought-given to irrelevance-perceived was astounding. We thought it was an absurd exchange, so wanted to share with the rest of staff. At least it wasn't a repeat of the time The Director was convinced no more than fifteen oranges could be in any one room in a domestic home at the same time, for risk of dimensional collapse.
deepdive — 09/09/2020
Pager Message: The Director would like to express to the Visitor in The Atrium who hypothesises that you could acquire any item from a child for $100, that, while children are largely stupid, that $5000 or less is an estimate that The Director had accounted for in the case of a particularly evil and or cunning child who, with no concept of the actual value of money, may start demanding money in the several hundreds, or billions. The Director hypothesises that about $5000 to the average child is incomprehensible as they do not ever engage in transactions that diverge from $1 to, in young adults, $100. So the offer of $5000 could potentially cover for all edge cases. You should never expect to pay a child more than $5000 for any of their goods, in the unlikely event they have anything even approaching valuable.
Pager Message: The Director would also like to express that if it upsets or distresses you that he has spent any more than a few seconds on the thought experiment, that he is almost certainly twice as upset with himself.
deepdive — 09/10/2020
Pager Message: To The Visitors in The Atrium inquiring and organising an inter-building visitor book club, Logistics would like to extend you the courtesy to submit the request in #the-suggestions-room and they will look into it. Currently, The Reading Cloister has been empty for some time, as operations in Building 17 have been keeping Staff quite busy since arrival at Lake Hemming, and access may be granted to Visitors if they so wish to have a dedicated space to read and discuss literature of any kind.
Pager Message: To The Visitor who suggested a dedicated room for 'napping' please note it is technically possible to sleep in any location in Building 17, though, lounges or waiting rooms are usually the most comfortable.
deepdive — 09/11/2020
Pager Message: To Visitors in The Waiting Area and The Atrium Lounge who may be concerned that The Refreshments are stale, please note that due to the disturbances to the distribution mechanisms in Building 17 caused by an Anomaly being detected on The Eighteenth Floor, the Crackers provided are Long-Life Crackers, and are expected to pass their used by date sometime next century.
Pager Message: As per the last pager message, we have noticed that the Syphon Registry has archived a novel transmission coming from The Eighteenth Floor in the last 24 hours and can confirm the disturbance was coming from a nullified room. Logistics has deemed the resonance to be stable, and will begin the processes to returning some systems to operational order within the next week.
Pager Message: In reference to the last two Pager Messages, The Culinary Department would like to express that due to refreshment deliveries being backed up, that more than 90% of fresh produce in Building 17 has needed to be recycled and composted. Due to a shortage of fresh produce, when Refreshment Distribution comes back online, unique Refreshments will be delivered once a week, except for special occasions or rewards, and will also continue to supply Long-Life Crackers.
deepdive — 09/11/2020
Pager Message: To Visitors on The Third Floor. There is piece of ephemera that was shared in The Waiting Room on The Third Floor that opened The Animal Room for previous Visitors, but was not required to be decoded and solved by the current Visitors on The Third Floor. As it would be important to decode what information was available in said document, if The Correct Answer is given to The Door, Five more Enclosures will be added to The Animal Room.
Pager Message: To All Visitors, this information can only be given to The Door by Visitors on The Third Floor, not Atrium Visitors who already have the information available to them. We also encourage Visitors in The Atrium to not blatantly hand said information to Visitors on The Third Floor, as it is forbidden to share information about Building 17 with Visitors of a lower access, naturally.
Pager Message: It has come to our attention that there is an Error in a previous Pager Message. The Animal Room was not opened via The Obsolete Ephemera, however, said Ephemera is relevant to The Animal Room and was decoded by previous Visitors along their path. As such, the Ephemera was not needed to be explicitly decoded by current Visitors on The Third Floor. The Ephemera in question has been pinned to the board in The Waiting Room on The Third Floor.
Pager Message: Logistics has awarded itself an Error for highlighting the Error.
Pager Message: Someone from Logistics just returned to The Logistics Department looking quite confused. They said they didn't want to talk about it.
Pager Message: The Director is planning on watching a film during his quad-daily hour-long free-form work-day rest period, and will do so over the The Intercom shortly.
Pager Message: The Casual Broadcast will now play over The Intercom.

Pager Message: If any Visitors in The Atrium would care to use their day pass to a Lower Floor, please contact Maintenance from any Waiting Room or Lounge.
deepdive — 09/11/2020
Pager Message: To Visitors on The Third Floor, a solution is currently in the process of being decoded by a single Visitor. For new visitors, Logistics encourages you to assist, especially if you have yet to collaborate on a solution for The Door since your initial Hallways.
deepdive — 09/12/2020
Pager Message: To Visitors currently interacting with The Door, the symbols added to the two most recent attempts were added to a previous answer also, the closest of the three.
Pager Message: In reference to the previous Pager Message, Visitors are reminded they may use an Error Pending to ask for a hint, though close as you are, may be a waste. However, Errors Pending may also be used to gain insight into symbols used in feedback responses from The Door.
Pager Message: To Visitors currently interacting with The Door, Logistics is unsure what a B.W.A is, but, is quite certain it is incorrect.
deepdive — 09/12/2020
Pager Message: The Director hopes that Visitors at The Door do not name every variation of meat, or meals that contain beef, as there are quite a few of them.
Pager Message: Womley has insisted that Logistics expresses that if it helps, he is trying to cut bread out of his diet, though, his favourite meal does have carbs in it, so, it's a bit of a losing battle.
Pager Message: Maintenance are very stressed out trying to manage response pings from The Door as well as sensor potentially transgressive, and unanticipated intimate scenes from broadcast in The Intercom.
Pager Message: Womley has insisted that Logistics expresses that if it helps, his favourite meal was one his family used to make on their farm when he was a child, made from various produce and protein. Though, we are asking Womley to leave The Logistics Department at the current time for being too helpful. However, since The Door is expected to open a hatch and not a door, we will allow it.
deepdive — 09/12/2020
Pager Message: Womley would like to commend The Visitor for correctly highlighting that a cow, as a bull, are not the same thing, and do have differences in their biological sex. The Animal that was recently transferred to The Animal Room is a Dairy Cow, and while we welcome all manner of naming conventions in Building 17, Womley, being a Zoologist, among other things, feels that it is a relevant thing to consider. However, there is a Penguin named Valium, and an animal with an official exclamation mark on it's naming certificate, so, your collective creativity is also commended.
Pager Message: Womley would also like to reiterate that no animals housed and studied in Building 17 are harmed, nor are they eaten, or used to prepare the refreshments. Eggs and Dairy Products are occasionally sourced, however.

Pager Messages: A message from Jimenez to D'Orldo: There's something waiting to be collected from The Mail Room if you have a moment, though, concerning that, we're expecting an extended potential power charge to the object due to resonances from the electrical storm, though, the power cycle won’t last more than 24 hours, to be sure. If you miss the window, come see us at Hypothetical Tech if you get a moment.
deepdive — 09/13/2020
Pager Message: A message from Jimenez to D'Orldo: Heda, we're picking up a signal that the prototype device is active. So, if you're interfacing, Hypothetical Tech have pretty much narrowed down that Halloway's Password must have something to do with his message to Machindian at the tail end of the Device. Machindian, however, won't make a peep about it. So, good luck.
Pager Message: Laughter is heard coming from The Directors Office, something in The A Room seems to have made him laugh.
Pager Message: Oh, he stopped laughing.

deepdive — 09/14/2020
Pager Message: Logistics is wondering if New Visitors perhaps have never heard of a hearing aid, or it's purpose. Likewise, if New Visitors are aware of what the purpose of an Ear is. Often they consider reprogramming The Door's responses, but in such a case, it is widely accepted to perhaps be the most evident of all The Door's responses across the board.

Likewise, that  Logistics hopes that Visitors making attempts at The Door will not try every variation of dishes that might contain Watermelon, as there are also quite a few of them.

Pager Message: Hypothetical and Theoretical Technologies would like to express that Visitors are not deemed Transgressors for dealing with Transgressive Technology. It is however unsafe to dismantle a Device before it has been nullified for Visitor and Building 17 safety, and so, certain Visitors are simply ineligible to interface with Devices until after they have been nullified.

Pager Message: To All Visitors in The Waiting Area: Feel free to encourage Visitors in a non-explicit way that exercising skills other than language and spelling are encouraged while in Building 17.
Pager Message: The Acoustics Department feels that since a new Visitor has not mentioned notes, specifically notes available to them, that they are perhaps not yet fully engaged in the exploration that is necessary for them to fully grasp what is being asked of them.

Pager Message: The Director would like Tectonics Convolution to be aware there have been whispers on the same frequencies that recently broadcast and transmitted a piece of transgressive media has appeared once again on our system. We are monitoring the situation closely.

Pager Message: Logistics has noticed that in The White Board Room there is far less mention of decoded reactions from The Door than have been given to Visitors with access to that room in the past.
Pager Message: Logistics would like to correct their previous Pager Message, in that the mentions are there, however, they are not represented by symbols, and so they missed it the first time.
deepdive — 09/17/2020
Pager Message: Maintenance apologise for the spontaneous test broadcasts lately, Visitors. Your patience is appreciated.
Pager Message: Visitors are reminded that The Door will no longer consider specific geographical proximity in responses to The Door, and Visitors should not take responses to be in reference to geographical proximity of geographical based answers.

If Errors are highlighted by Atrium Visitors with Higher Access as a means of flagging Errors for Visitors with Lower Access, the Error will not be awarded.
deepdive — 09/17/2020
Pager Message: As per our last message, Logistics feels that Errors are more useful to Visitors who need them, and hopes to mitigate Higher Access Visitors acutely searching for Errors in Common Areas to Highlight when they may not be of much use to them.

deepdive — 09/17/2020
Pager Message: Logistics can confirm that the recent Braille Encoded Message does not contain any Radio Frequencies, however, does mention Transgressors by Name.

Pager Message: The Electrical Storm is imminent. We recommend inexperienced Visitors, particularly those who do not have access to The Atrium to exercise caution, and/or, avoid The Intercom entirely due to potential Temporal Fluctuations and potential Transgressive Materials that have appeared on our system over the past 48 hours.

Pager Message: The Casual Broadcast will now play over The Intercom.
deepdive — 09/18/2020
Pager Message: Communications has completed a surface analysis of the Transgressive Transmissions from the past 24 Hours. Communications has confirmed it is a repeat of similar Transgressive Transmissions from the past. For New Visitors unfamiliar with the protocol for Transgressive Transmissions, please note; any mention by name of The Transgressive Transmission will be removed from Building 17's Memory Archive. Likewise, we deeply encourage Visitors to not seek out mention of The Transgressive Transmission from Outside of Building 17, as we suspect Transgressors will make further attempts to commune with Visitors.

Pager Message: Logistics would like to remind Visitors that although the File Names of Ephemera are often significant, that not all relative Ephemera File Names are necessarily relevant as specific Responses to The Door, but rather, may help you ascertain the Ephemera's significance.
Pager Message: Logistics are curious what Box that the Visitors at The Door are talking about, considering the Box that they are trying to open is inside Building 17. However, perhaps taking stock of what you may have already uncovered, and taking a break in The Music Room will be of more use to your time and deduction.
deepdive — 09/20/2020
Pager Message: It has come to Communication’s attention of a potential Coincidence to be investigated by Cartography. A Musical Act very closely related to the Musical Act that is credited for a particular Transgressive Transmission that plagues Building 17 have recently shared information that may coincidently be related to Transgressors. Like us in Building 17, we hope that if it is not a coincidence, that the parties in question also share a pursuit of Transgressive Individuals.

Pager Message: The Casual Broadcast will now play over The Intercom.
Pager Message: In the effort of best understanding Transgressors to avoid the transmission of Transgressive Information, recent contact with a Transgressor in Building 14 resulted in the transmission of a greeting to "Commander Keen" - as has been deliberated in The Atrium Lounge, there is no member of staff called Commander Keen, and we have taken it to simply be a play on the word "Keen" for the Visitor conversing with The Transgressor in a very forward and abrupt manner. We also believe it is a reference to a classic computer video game of the same name, with a spritely and enthusiastic protagonist.

The safest extrapolation of Ketchup in an obscurely objective sense could be seen as, well, that Ketchup is really a borderline savoury jam. Sauces, while technically drinkable, could not really be considered beverages in the traditional sense, and smoothies are certainly Beverages. Have a nice day.

We’re pleased to share with you all the Building 17 Annual Crossword, which should be arriving in The Mail Room at any moment. As usual, completed entries can go through Maintenance to maintain confidentiality. Also, we understand there are Visitors who have access to the mailroom. To you all, please note the Building 17 Annual Crossword is not particularly intended for Visitors, and there may be a couple answers that you simply do not know the answer to, but, we thought, therein is a puzzle in and of itself. Likewise, Visitors who do not have access to the mail room will find the crossword almost certainly impossible to complete, but not completely impossible, so if any visitors at all get their hands on a copy of the crossword and it's clues, you're welcome to attempt to solve the whole thing. There's a reward, naturally. Have fun, and Happy Day Day!

Apparently, someone had submitted an interpretation of "Silas", whoever Silas is, no one would tell the Logistics Representative who Silas is supposed to be, anyway, apparently someone made the bold iteration of Silas being represented as female, and it had never occurred to either department that perhaps Silas would just be feeling that way some days.

One said to the other "Hm... Perhaps a helix shaped bulb was, in fact, not the vibe at all!" Sure, sure. Great, good for you all, and Silas, too. But this is Logistics Department, though, not The Lightbulb Department.

Pager Message: Gasps and emphatic applause and cheering from Hypothetical Technologies and The Art Department. As a member of The Art Department and Hypothetical Tech came into Logistics to put yet another picture of Silas on our fridge with the High Powered Magnet, they seemed to be talking about whatever they were applauding. 
One said; "Finally someone represents the void as it should be: like an ocean of multi-coloured shimmering effervescent ethereal tide pools, convalescing into an impossible visage of endless depth, motion and perceptual encompassing." 
Then the other said "Whatever the opposite of colour blindness is, you've got it. A truly wonderful design, though." 
Then they first one replied "... Sure, the next thing you're going to tell me is Rainbows are supposed to be colourful."
The other one didn't reply. Well, whoever did something, whatever it was, good for you, they seemed to really like it. Now I'm going to stare at our fridge and wonder, without the knowledge of what Silas is, no matter how many times I am taken aside and calmly explained that "Silas is a Shadow Goblin", I simply must believe there is more to Silas. Silas, if you're reading this, and you are real, just know, I make great soup and I have great taste in both music and films.

Get it? Day in the Sun? Haha." Other things that were heard were; "Oh, and more cereals should come in tubes... It is the way of the world. Nothing pours out easier that from within a tube" and "if only they knew the true cost of one single box of SunOs, it would be cheaper to go to Mars and make some MarsOs from Mars Dirt.

To clarify, we mean the entire floor, not the floor you walk on, but rather the entire floor; hallways, rooms, the lot, which, well, also includes the actual floor, too.
